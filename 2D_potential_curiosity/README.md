# 2D potential simulations

Here is a directory from which you can repeat 2D Potential simulations. The directory `SEED_1` provides files and parameters for a simulation with a random seed set to 1. To repeat all 10 runs, you have to copy this directory into 9 different directories. Then inside the code (`01_2Dfunnel_rev_longer.ipynb`), change the line `ALL_RND_SEED=1` to a number from `2 .. 10`. Then run Jupyter Notebook server on your node and start the simulation by executing Jupyter Notebook's code.
