# WLALL5 simulations

Here is a directory from which you can repeat WLALL5 simulations. The directory `SEED_1` provides files and parameters for a simulation with a random seed set to 1. To repeat all 10 runs, you have to copy this directory into 9 different directories. Then inside the code (`Run_AdaptiveBandit.py`), change the line `ALL_RND_SEED=1` to a number from `2 .. 10`.
